# Use on YOUR website!
It's simple, just download the wiishopscrollbar folder and put this in any html page that u need it in:
<br>
``<link rel="stylesheet" href="/wiishopscrollbar/wiiscrollbar.css">``
<br>
(or, use https://thewiiarchivist.github.io/Wii-Shop-Channel---scrollbar-remake/) only for my sites tho as i dont think it would allow that due to CORS)
<br>
( change the path of stuff if needed )
<br>

# Example:
This is how it will look if imported correctly:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ea0649-675b-435a-a346-94af5e5ce6e1">


<p>Please note that not all browsers support the arrow parts so it might just appear as a scrollbar with only the graident part/button.</p>
