# Wii-Shop-Channel---scrollbar-remake
Remake of the Wii Shop scrollbar in HTML 5!
<br>
<small style="font-weight:bold;">Please note that not all browsers support the arrow parts so it might just appear as a scrollbar with only the graident part/button. </small>
# Use on YOUR website!
It's simple, just download the wiishopscrollbar folder and put this in any html page that u need it in:
<br>
``<link rel="stylesheet" href="/wiishopscrollbar/wiiscrollbar.css">``
<br>
( change the path of stuff if needed )
<br>

# Example:
This is how it will look if imported correctly:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ea0649-675b-435a-a346-94af5e5ce6e1">

# Improvements to the graident on the button is welcome!
